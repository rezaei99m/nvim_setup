In this repo I will neovim and vim stuff from installing neovim to plugins. It is for my personal use, but I hope somebody can find it useful :)

# Installing neovim

- First go to this [website](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/) and download the latest release for your system.
- Then extract the compressed file in to every folder you want.
- Then for accessing nvim easily add bin folder full path of extracted folder to your environment variables.
- you can access nvim every time you open a new terminal and type nvim (stands for neovim).

```Terminal
nvim
```
